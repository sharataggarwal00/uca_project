L-O-T-T-E-R-Y Game

This program implements a lottery game. It asks the user for 6 different numbers between the range of
1 and 40. A circular doubly linked list is created with 40 nodes and a separate value is assigned to 
each node from 1 to 40. A random number, say 'n' is then selected, and the list is traversed n times.
This happens for 6 times. Each time the list is traversed, it returns the value of that node to see 
if the value of the node matches the user's number.

**HEADER FILES INCLUDED**
-ctype.h : contains inbuilt functions to handle characters in C. For eg. isalpha(), isalnum(), isblank(), etc
